# Status

Updated 2026-10-05. This file records current state; detailed evidence is linked, not duplicated.

## Now

- **Latest instruction: continue design, combination and experiments to improve the complete score.**
  The common edit origin is direct matching from raw frozen-DINOv3 l24, not FoRIS. FoRIS, INSID3 and
  other methods become comparison rows. Prior FoRIS-relative budgets remain historical diagnostics.
  User resumed pipeline work after improving SSH. Isolated consecutive GPU stages are staged under
  `launch/resume_dev241_20261005_v1`; supervisor PID 5561 is live and waiting for GPU. Current live check is still no-card (0.5 CPU / 2 GiB).
  No rental/download or heavy no-card computation is allowed.
- Astra's supplied complete candidate is retained: exposed DEV220, 1024, +2.751185
  [1.102142, 3.810278] versus native and +0.709731 [-0.704856, 1.334083] versus RCG.
  Its unchanged source, controls, statistics and DEV241 replay command are prepared locally.
  It restricts deletion location, sets a reference-BG count and ranks with RCG; it adds no foreground
  beyond RCG. See [intake](../../evidence/local/research_20261005/astra_intake.md).
- **D is not a validated method/base.** Full DEV241, 1024 complete masks: native 59.074825;
  D 59.192751, +0.117926 [-0.828163, +1.581804]. D is -1.826908 [-3.078843, -0.115249]
  versus RCG. Arrived100 loses 1.703 points. The first20 +3.260 was not stable.
- Native replay audit is complete: only two episodes differ (20 and 5 pixels), with class-mIoU drift
  -0.00001536. Both baselines are reported; public replay of those exact cases remains a diagnostic task.
  The drift neither invalidates all predictions nor establishes bitwise identity. See
  [audit](../../evidence/local/research_20261005/native_replay_audit.md).
- RCG full DEV241: 61.019660 versus native 59.074825, +1.944835 [0.983141, 2.913596].
  Delta-only readout is 60.198027. No new complete method has established stable >=2 over native.
- Latest correction: evidence must distinguish wrong-object deletion, boundary leakage removal,
  whole-object recovery and extent completion. Prioritize deployable addition signals; measure separate
  add/delete edits and their combination. GT error categories/oracles are diagnostics, not inference inputs.
- 20/50 cases are execution/gross-failure checks, not a reliable +2-point selector. Meaningful efficacy
  decisions now use the existing DEV241 cohort. All reused data remain DEV, never independent confirmation.
- Existing GPU: reported 32GB, 12 CPU, 62GiB RAM. No artificial duration or round limits. Keep useful work
  prepared ahead, share one DINO encoder, parallelize model-free GPU algebra and CPU evaluation/diagnosis.
  Newly started research agents use GPT-6.1-sol/xhigh. Live work and ownership: [PLAN](../research/PLAN.md).

## Measured / recorded

- The base-class-fitted FoRIS readout has an original-resolution CONFIRM600 positive result; it is supervised.
- Dots' RCG result is on exposed old120 at 1024 working resolution, not original-resolution confirmation.
- Original-resolution DEV241 matte did not establish an advantage over complete FoRIS or delete-only control.
- SAM3 visual/naming results belong to a different resource setting. None establishes the primary DINO claim.
- Numeric comparisons, intervals and sources are in CLAIM and the [ledger](../../evidence/local/RESULTS.md).

## Unverified / held

- The original dots snapshot had new100 unscored and 21 missing. The later Astra package now supplies
  scored220 evidence and a portable replay; its 21 remaining DEV cases have not been run by that package.
- Original-resolution independent confirmation of the cloud candidate is absent.
- The new batch is in [preparation record](../../evidence/local/research_20261005/README.md). Native replay, real encoder hooks and CRF passed the first20 comparison. Full-cohort efficacy remains
  under evaluation; all data are DEV.
- Preparation inventory confirmed endpoint 48002 in no-card mode at 0.5 CPU / 2 GiB, existing DINOv3 weights,
  241 feature/packet pairs and all 241 reference/query image/mask paths. No experiment process was observed.
  That no-card capacity has been superseded by the live GPU inventory above.
- Manifest audit: no duplicate episode identities, 239 photo-connected groups, including two shared-photo
  pairs. Old120 photo identities match; new100 matches exported keys only. All 241 are development data.

## Needed from the user

- Current hardware availability is being checked. Preparation and analysis continue. No rental, download,
  commit, push or shutdown was performed. Full-rate CPU work requires a suitably provisioned machine;
  CPU-only code does not mean the 0.5-core no-card mode is suitable.
